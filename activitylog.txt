ideas 

my thoughts are we need something detailed enough to make it easy to demonstrate OOP stuff but avoid 
getting in the weeds to far and burying ourselves
  requirements:
  - inheritance
  - polymorphism
  - data hiding / encapsulation
  - interfaces
  - gui
  - exception handling
  - class hierarchy

my ideas
- [ ] basic text adventure
- [ ] RPG character generator and character sheet maker
- [ ] (don't get an erection Patrick) simple chess simulator
- [ ] Tire shop inventory and sales system
- [ ] household inventory system
- [ ] bank system
- [ ] geneology system
- [ ] RPG fight game
- [ ] Haz Mat inventory and documentation
- [ ] household expense system
- [ ] book inventory
- [ ] basic restaurant PoS system
- [ ] animal classification system
- [ ] movie inventory system with different classes for different movie genre

my considerations
- [ ] turn based strategy war game incorporate Coast Guard
- [ ] stock ticker/ recommendation / store
- [ ] Teaching program like an interactive teaching all the listed items
